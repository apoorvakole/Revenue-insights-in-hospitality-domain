# Revenue insights in hospitality domain

This is the dataset analyzed by me for Challenge #1 of [Codebasics Resume Project Challenge](https://codebasics.io/event/codebasics-resume-project-challenge).

 ## **Problem Statement**-
      Atliq Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, Atliq Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of Atliq Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” in order to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them insights from their historical data.

## **It consists of**-
      Calculated metrics such as total revenue , ADR, RevPAR, total bookings, average rating, total capacity, total successful bookings,occupancy % cancellation rate. Revenue contributions as per city, property name, room class,etc. Bookings overview, filters, KPIs .

## **Key learnings**-

       1. First and foremost skill I developed is Storytelling with data provided.
       2. Understanding stakeholder needs.
       3. KPIs for hospitality domain.
       4. Using monotonic colour pallete for effective dashboard.
       5. Data modelling.
